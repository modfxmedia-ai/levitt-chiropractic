      "Chiropractic can help reduce the severity and the frequency of your allergies. Chiropractic does not work like an anti-histamine as a direct, short-term relief from allergies. Instead, chiropractic allows your body to be better equipped to fight against allergies.",
      "Allergies are a reaction by your immune system to an allergen (substances that normally have no effect on people) resulting in sneezing, coughing, congestion, hives, rashes, and in severe cases, seizure and anaphylactic shock. These symptoms are caused by the histamines your immune system creates in an attempt to protect your body against the allergen.",
      "When your spine is misaligned it can impinge on the nervous system in your body. Studies have shown that the nervous system has an effect on the functionality of your immune system. When your nervous system is under stress, your immune system cannot work at an optimal level. Chiropractors work with the nervous system by aligning the spine to relieve any stress on nerves — this allows the immune system to work at a higher level, making it easier to fight off infections while recognizing allergens.",

    paragraphs: [
      "Degenerative disc disease is not as much a disease as it is a name for the changes that can happen to the spine as we age. Our discs are made of a tough, rubbery exterior and a soft interior. They sit between the vertebrae to act as shock absorbers. As we age, the spinal discs begin to degenerate — which can cause herniated discs, bulging discs, spinal stenosis, and osteoarthritis.",
      "The degeneration of spinal discs may cause no symptoms at all, and symptoms depend on each patient and the severity of their case. Pain may occur at the site of the affected disc in the back or neck. As the pain is often caused by compressed nerves, this pain can also travel to other areas of the body like the buttocks, arms, and legs. Numbness and tingling in the arms and legs may also be experienced.",
      "Our spines can degenerate as a natural part of aging. Tears in the tougher outer layer of the disc are common as we grow older, and when the discs begin to lose fluid, they become smaller and less flexible. In addition to aging, other factors include obesity, smoking, repeated physical work, and injury.",

      "Intervertebral discs are positioned between the vertebrae in the spine. The outside of a disc is made from cartilage, and in the center is a jelly-like solution. These discs serve many purposes, including allowing movement of the spine, creating space between the vertebrae, and acting as shock absorbers.",
      "Trauma to the spine can cause the discs to herniate, bulge, become displaced (slipped disc), or even rupture. Trauma is not the only cause — as we get older, the discs can begin to weaken and dehydrate. These conditions can put pressure on the nerves around the spine and cause pain.",
      "If you suffer from one of these injuries you should see a chiropractor. Surgery is risky, expensive, and requires recovery time. In many cases, you can experience relief from these conditions through chiropractic — by properly aligning the spine, pressure can be relieved on nerves and on the discs themselves.",

The main symptom of fibromyalgia is chronic pain throughout the body, mainly located in joints. The pain may be achy, sharp, radiating, burning, or shooting — and it may be mild or severe. Fibromyalgia has also been known to bring on other conditions like trouble sleeping, headaches, depression, and anxiety.",
      "While there is no known cure for fibromyalgia, chiropractic treatment can help to uncover what may be causing the pain and also provide relief for the pain. The cause could be physical, mental, or emotional, so a full examination will be performed.",

The added effects of chiropractic treatment such as increased energy levels, better circulation, and a stronger immune system can also help fight the effects of fibromyalgia.

      "Many people believe that headaches are caused by loud noise, being tired, or being stressed. While these are all factors that can lead to headaches, the direct cause is tightness in the neck and shoulders. The tightness can cause misalignments in the vertebrae of your neck, resulting in pain.",
      "80% of all headaches originate from the neck. With a typical cervicogenic (neck origin) headache, a person usually feels pain starting at the base of the skull which radiates into the temples, eyeballs, and forehead.",

It can be caused by an injury, poor posture, overuse/underuse of a joint, muscle imbalance, and other factors. Like arthritis, joint dysfunction can cause pain in the joint and the surrounding muscles, and can also cause problems in other parts of the body due to overcompensation.",
      "One common form of joint dysfunction is sacroiliac joint dysfunction, which occurs where the base of the spine meets the pelvis. It causes low back pain and prohibits movement. This condition is often misdiagnosed because the symptoms are similar to sciatica or a herniated disc.",

      "Pain along the spinal column in your neck or back is usually caused by subluxations, or misalignments of your vertebrae. A small misalignment can cause pain by putting pressure on nerves. Left untreated, these subluxations can cause muscle spasms and increasing pain.",

Arthritis can be painful and can cause the affected areas to not function properly. Arthritis in one area can cause arthritis or other problems in a different joint due to overcompensation.",
      "Pain killers can cause temporary relief from pain and discomfort, but it is not a long-term solution. Chiropractic can alleviate pain by releasing pressure on the nervous system with proper alignment. It can also restore proper joint movement, helping to ensure you use proper motion so you do not cause injury to other parts of your body.",

      "Whiplash is a common injury for people involved in car collisions. When a car is struck from behind or collides with another object, it causes the neck to snap back and forth violently. This causes the muscles and ligaments to overextend, leading to strains and/or tears — referred to as soft tissue damage.",
      "Whiplash can also cause structural damage such as misaligned vertebrae, herniated, bulging or ruptured discs, or nerve damage due to the overextension from the violent movement.",
      "Chiropractic can help with both types of injuries. Adjustments and alignments can be performed specifically for those who have been in car accidents and suffered from whiplash. The pressure on the discs and nerves is released when the spine is returned to its proper alignment. Chiropractic massage can be used to help relieve the pain and discomfort from soft tissue injuries.",
